* Data related to Space Exploration was collected and stored in training.txt file. 
* Sample lines from dataset:
"Why is Mars called the Red Planet?
The bright rust color Mars is known for is due to iron-rich minerals in its regolith â€” the loose dust and rock covering its surface. Earth's soil is a kind of regolith, too, albeit one loaded with organic content. According to NASA, the iron minerals oxidize, or rust, causing the soil to look red."
